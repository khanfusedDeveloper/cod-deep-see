Contains Images from Call of Duty Modern Warfare & Warzone gameplay and has labels for Enemy and Head.

Originally used to train a Yolov5 model to detect when enemies are in view and used a GIMX adapter with Python to send movement controls to connected PS4. Find the complete code on my Github.

This dataset can be used to train custom Computer Vision models to recognize when enemy players appear and locate them.
